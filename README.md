# Ride Along

Ride Along is a web app that allows users to find and post trips that other users can join. Users have the ability to review their past drivers, and chat with other people interested in the trip. We have a unique search feature -- users donâ€™t need to match exactly on beginning and end points. They will be matched if their beginning and end points lie within existing available routes. This is particularily useful for users in small towns because they typically have less options, and with our app they can be matched with rides that pass through their area.
